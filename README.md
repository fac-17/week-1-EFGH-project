## WHY (describing the purpose)
For Founders & Coders week 1, in order to practice git we built a basic website for a web development agency. 

## WHAT (describing your site)
Our site should satisfies the following user stories: 

1. As a client looking to hire a team of developers I want to visit your site and immediately see a headline about your team So that I get a concise description of what you have to offer me.

2. As a client looking to hire a team of developers I want to visit your site and see a navigation link for 'About, Team, and Contact' so I can quickly navigate to the areas of the site I'd like to visit.

3. As a client looking to hire a team of developers I want to be able to contact the developers by filling out and submitting a form by providing my name, email and message information So that the team have sufficient information to contact me afterwards

4. As a client looking to hire a team of developers I want to click on a navigation link and a corresponding section be made visible in the browser window on the same page So that I can quickly navigate around the site without having to wait for new pages to be loaded.

5. As a client looking to hire a team of developers I want to easily view the site when browsing on my mobile, tablet or desktop so that I can understand the sites content easily on whatever device I choose to view it in.

6. As a visually impaired client... I would like to easily read and understand the text on your site so I can understand the information available

7. As a blind client... I would like to easily understand how to navigate the site after my screen reader reads me the content of the site so I can understand the information available.

8. As a client with JavaScript disabled in their browser for security reasons I would like to visit your site and get a similar experience to viewing your site on a modern browser with JavaScript enabled so that I don't feel like I'm completely in the stone age.


## HOW (describing the journey to completion)

### We used pair programming!!!

We switched pairs three times and used mostly backseat driver approach. 

We ensured each pull request was reviewed by the oppsite pair. 

### We used whiteboarding and paper wireframes

### Key design decisions: 
1. We built our site without JavaScript
2. We followed a classic site layout with simple navbar that is always visible. 
3. We used semantic HTML
4. We regularly used Accessibility audits to ensure we were following best practices
